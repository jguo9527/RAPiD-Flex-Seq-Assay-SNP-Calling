# RAPiD_Flex_Seq_Assay_SNP_Calling
Repository for documenting a SNP calling pipeline for RAPiD Flex-Seq assay

* `R_script` documents R scripts for running the SNP calling pipeline for 100 SNPs
* `Input` include the input data for the pipeline which was generated by authors from `Example_input_files_v2.R`
* `Output` include the SNP calling results in `rds` format

Explanation on the scripts and data:

  * GenotypeCall.R = main script for setting genotype call parameters and invoking external functions
  * FunctionPriors.R = external function for calculating SNP priors
  * Function_callGenotypes.R = external function for calling SNPs and calculating statistics
  * reads_input_100.rds = input file of read counts (100 SNPs x 100 samples)
  * snp_input_100.rds = input file of SNP info (100 SNPs)
  - Additional data:
    - reads_input_all.rds = input files of all RG read counts (diploid data)
    - snp_input_all.rds = input files of all RG SNPs
